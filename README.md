**P.S.** Yes, this project was made with Generative AI — but here’s the thing: not everyone can just throw prompts at an AI and magically end up with a functional, visually appealing UI.  
It takes skill to guide the AI, refine its messy outputs, and turn them into something polished — and I did that in *very little time*.  

So, while the code may have started in the AI’s hands, the final product reflects **my ability to prompt, adapt, and design**. That’s the real skill I’m showing here 🚀
